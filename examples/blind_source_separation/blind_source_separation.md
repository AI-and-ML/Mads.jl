## Blind Source Separation

Frequently there are several different physical phenomena or mechanisms (sources) than may can cause transients in the observed data.

For example, in the case water-level (hydraulic pressure) data, these might me barometric pressure fluctuations, tidal effects, pumping effects, etc.
In the case of geochemical concentrations, these may represent a mixture of different groundwater sources with different initial geochemical compositions.

The separation of the different signals observed in the data is important for conceptualization of the site conditions.

Below we present synthetic examples how transient data can be used to identify (separate/unmix) the original signals.

More complicated BSS analyses can be found in:
